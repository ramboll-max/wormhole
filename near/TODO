big tasks

1) Look at emitter() in the portal

   a) Is the way I am handling the attached deposit... correct? 

      If yes, lets change the rest of the system to do something
      similar...  We are not doing it correctly anywhere else..

      If no, then what IS the correct way?

   b) does the attached gas get refunded correctly to the user?

   c) in the cross contract call inside the wormhole/publish_message,
      what gas is that using?  who is paying for it?

2) rethink/remove unwindState

3) Create an account for $NEAR during boot... keeping it out of the
   portal account in case we have a bug which allows people to burn
   the $NEAR in the portal account

4) Add attest

5) add sendTransfer

6) turn test/watcher.go into a near guardian watcher.go implementation
   Will our tx_hash be the chunk_id?  or the recept_id?

   ** first pass done **

7) Think about how we will do recovery/observations...  How will we
   find the blocks that contain the requested sequence numbers?

8) Are we emitting all the correct messages in contract/ft so that the
   indexer is happy?

9) add default contract deployer and registrations

10) make test.ts use upgrade protocol to upgrade contract if it is already there
   (implement upgrade protocol)
